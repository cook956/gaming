### `Follow Up Questions`

1) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test (not including learning)?

    I have spent approximately 11hrs on this app.

2) Did you have to learn any new languages/technologies? If so, which ones and what resources did you use for your learning?

    Yes, I had to learn 'React' to do so I had to reinforce my javascript knowledge. Alongside that Github usage was new to me also. 
Amongst other resources most of my learning has been with CodeAcademy. I have used the Airbnb and Facebook react & javascript style guides.

3) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

    I would of liked to make the Player contact details hidden with the ability to interact with the row to drop down, further contact information. Had time permitted, also to have a filter by game option. 

4) What did you spend the most time on? What did you find most difficult?

    I spent most time on understanding the transition from 'Props' to 'State', equally this was the most difficult part as the whole approach to interacting with information like this is new to me.

5) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test weâ€™d love to hear them.

    I found the test to be a great exercise. I thoroughly enjoyed making something that challenged me, for me it was the correct amount of 'difficult' without proving itself to be unsatisfying. I am unable to suggest any improvements at this piont.
